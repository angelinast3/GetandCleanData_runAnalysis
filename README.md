# GetandCleanData_runAnalysis
peer graded assignment for week 4

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This will be graded by peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. There will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set, 2) a link to a Github repository, and 3) a code book called CodeBook.md. There should also be a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

How to reproduce this result:
1) Download file and put in the working directory: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

6) Get activity labels, attach to activity codes
7) Combine training and testing subjectid
8) Combine subjects and activities
